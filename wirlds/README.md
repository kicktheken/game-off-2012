## Gameplay Notes
* Treasure chests increase your line of sight as well as increase your final score
* Your final score is inversely proportional to the distance your hero traveled plus the amount of treasure chests found
* Ores randomly give you a nonwood resource or none at all
* Crystals correspond to one of the five environments you'll encounter (badlands, desert, grassland, forest, tundra).
* Gold, sulfur, mercury, and gems appear at increasing altitudes away from water in that order
* You can cheat by adding `?mapreveal` in front of the url as a GET parameter (.ie http://localhost/wirlds?mapreveal)
* You can revisit a certain world by copying the seed number and putting it as your GET parameter (.ie http://localhost/wirlds/?1354314043038)

## Setup

Download image assets [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1065170/img.tar.gz) and save them to wirlds/client/img. This is because these are various sprites taken from Heroes of Might and Magic&#174; 3, World of Warcraft&#174;, and [BrowserQuest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/). Then simply run the game by pointing your web server to wirlds/client. Tested on various platforms:
*iOS 5, 6 on iPhone 4, 4S, 5
*Android 2.3, 3.1, 4.1 on various tablets and mobile devices
*IE 9, Chrome 21+, Firefox 16+, Safari 6.0+

Alternatively, you can build a minified version by simply running `sh wirlds/build.sh` and will create a `clientbuild` directory that can run the game
